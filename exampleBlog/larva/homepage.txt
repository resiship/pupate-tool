*Pupate example blog*
dateline ignored on homepage, won't be shown

Welcome to the Pupate example blog! This is what a blog made with Pupate looks like. Pupate sites don't _have_ to be blogs, but their simple structure works well for blogs.

Here you'll find examples of all Pupate's features. This is the homepage. Above you can see the title of the blog (which is also the title of the entry that is the homepage.) Below you can see the index: a list of all the site's entries and their dates.

On this particualr pupate site, each entry will be an example of a different feature of Pupate. They will show off _em_*bel*{ish}(tan){ments}(#88745b), \escape characters, RSS feed generation, and lots more :) Check out what's possible and make sure you see how it works by understanding how each entry's .txt file in the larva/ directory corresponds to its HTML output in the imago/ directory!
