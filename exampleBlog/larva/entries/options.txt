The options file
2022/03/12

Pupate's site-wide options come from the Options File. "options.txt" is located in the top level of the Pupate directory (alongside "larva/"). You can read about all the options, their available values, and their defaults in the documentation, but here's a quick discussion of this blog's options file:

   linkColorIs #cfddff
   textColorIs #cfddea
   backgroundColorIs #22272e
   showIndexWith dates
   sortIndexBy oldest
   pageURLsBasedOn filename
   outputLocationIs

First off, not all the options that Pupate has are in this options file. That's fine, Pupate will just use the defaults (which you can see in "defaults/options.txt"). For example, I'm not really using the RSS feature on this blog so I just ommitted the "RSSBaseURL" option. The default value "https://www.example.com" will get used, but I don't really care.

Also, not every option in the options file needs to have a value associated with it. In this case, the default will also be used. Here I like the default output location ("imago/") so I'm choosing not to change that option, but to remind myself that it exists, I'm leaving the "outputLocationIs" option keyword in the file, with nothing after it.

A lot of the style options take any CSS as a value, so you can add gradients and any CSS-parsable colors or sizes!

You can also use the CSS keywords "initial", "unset", "default" etc. to reset values to their browser-defined defaults rather than Pupate's defaults. If I included the line

   sizeIs default

in my options.txt, the font size would be the smaller browser default rather than the slightly bigger 16px that Pupate sets it to by default.

Blank lines in the options file are ignored so you can split your options into sections if you want.
