Embellishme*n*ts

Pupate entries are written in Pupate's WYSRDWYG embellishment markup. It's basically Markdown, but limited to just a few features.

Surround text in * to get bold: *bold*

And with _ to get italic: _italic!_

------

Familiarly, you can make links with square brackets and parantheses: [here's a link](https://www.example.com)

------

Unlike Markdown, you can make colored text! Use the same format as a link, but with curly-brackets instead of square ones. And in the parenthesis, put the CSS value of the color you'd like: {Colorful!}(red)

Any CSS value will work: {gray}(#999)

{r}(red){a}(orange){i}(yellow){n}(green){b}(blue){o}(indigo){w}(violet){!}(pink)

------

All these embellishments even work in the title (did you notice?)

------

You can also use the escape character (\\) if you want write something that would otherwise get parsed as an embellishment:

\[here's how you write a link!\](https://chicken.coop) <- this won't get linkified
