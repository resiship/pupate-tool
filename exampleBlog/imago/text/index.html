By default, Pupate uses a monospaced font. That makes it easy to do things like...

- make
- bulleted
- lists

    |-------------|
    | put         |
    |  some words |
    |   in a      |
    |  box        |

  Pupate won't break your leading or trailing spaces, and won't mess with your newlines. Everything as you type it.
