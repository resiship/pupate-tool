Pupate entries are written in Pupate's WYSRDWYG embellishment markup. It's basically Markdown, but limited to just a few features.

Surround text in * to get bold: <b>bold</b>

And with _ to get italic: <i>italic!</i>

------

Familiarly, you can make links with square brackets and parantheses: <a href="https://www.example.com">here's a link</a>

------

Unlike Markdown, you can make colored text! Use the same format as a link, but with curly-brackets instead of square ones. And in the parenthesis, put the CSS value of the color you'd like: <span style="color: red">Colorful!</span>

Any CSS value will work: <span style="color: #999">gray</span>

<span style="color: red">r</span><span style="color: orange">a</span><span style="color: yellow">i</span><span style="color: green">n</span><span style="color: blue">b</span><span style="color: indigo">o</span><span style="color: violet">w</span><span style="color: pink">!</span>

------

All these embellishments even work in the title (did you notice?)

------

You can also use the escape character (\) if you want write something that would otherwise get parsed as an embellishment:

[here's how you write a link!](https://chicken.coop) <- this won't get linkified</body>
</html>
