  <body>This is the title of the entry!
2022/03/08 <- (this is the date)

That (not so?) empty line above, separates the content from the title and date. It's always ignored by Pupate and should be left empty.

But everything below that is simply content! For ever and ever. And that's the layout of an entry in Pupate.

The one other thing to pay attention to is the <i>filename</i>. Sounds irrelevant right? Well depending on your options file, it could be used as the URL-slug for the page when it's generated. In this blog, it is!</body>
